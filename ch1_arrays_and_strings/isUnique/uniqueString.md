### Developing an Algorithm to Determine if a String Contains All Unique Extended ASCII Characters

#### Problem Description:
The objective is to design and implement an algorithm capable of efficiently determining whether a given string comprises entirely unique extended ASCII characters. In essence, the task is to create a function that accepts a string as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string contains only distinct characters from the extended ASCII character set or if there are any repeating characters.

#### Background:
In various computational scenarios, such as text analysis, file processing, and character encoding, it is crucial to rapidly ascertain whether a string contains exclusively unique characters from the extended ASCII character set. This challenge has significance in fields including natural language processing, digital forensics, and multimedia data handling.

#### Input:
A non-empty string consisting of characters from the extended ASCII character set. The string's length can vary from 1 to N, where N represents the maximum number of characters within the string.

#### Output:
A boolean outcome indicating whether all characters within the provided string are unique (```true```) or not (```false```).
```
Constraints:
1 ≤ Length of input string ≤ N (where N is the maximum length of the string)
The input string contains characters from the extended ASCII character set (0 to 255).
```
Evaluation Criteria:
The assessment of the algorithm will center on both its efficiency and accuracy. The implementation should aim to achieve a time complexity of no more than O(N) and should be capable of efficiently processing larger input strings. Additionally, the solution should exhibit clarity, well-structured organization, and comprehensive testing to ensure its reliability.

Note:
While multiple approaches exist to address this challenge, the key objective is to find a balance between computational efficiency and code simplicity. Candidates are encouraged to explore various techniques for solving the problem and provide a coherent rationale for their chosen approach.
